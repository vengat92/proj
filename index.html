      <h1>GitHub Pages Import</h1>
<p>As part of <a href="http://www.gunicorn.com/" title="Gunicorn">gunicorn</a>, <a href="http://github.com/benoitc" title="BenoÃ®t Chesneau">Benoit Chesneau</a> and I have been
starting to look at how to host documentation. There's the obvious method of
using <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/post-receive-hooks" title="GitHub Post-Receive Hook">GitHub's post-receive hook</a> to trigger doc builds and rsync
to a webserver, but we ended up wanting to try out github's hosting to make the
whole interface a bit more robust.</p>
<p><a href="http://pages.github.com/" title="GitHub Pages">GitHub Pages</a> is a pretty awesome service that GitHub provides for
hosting project documentation. The only thing is that it requires a
<code>gh-pages</code> branch that is the site's document root. This means that keeping
documentation sources in the branch with code is a bit difficult. And it really
turns into a head scratcher for things like <a href="http://sphinx.pocoo.org/" title="Sphinx Documentation">Sphinx</a> that want to
access documentation sources and code sources at the same time.</p>
<p>Then I stumbled across an interesting looking package called
<a href="http://dinoboff.github.com/github-tools/" title="github-tools">github-tools</a> that looked almost like what I wanted. It was a tad
complicated and more involved than I wanted but it gave me an idear. Why not
just write a script that can copy a directory to the <code>gh-pages</code> branch of the
repository. This saves me from even having to think about the branch and
everything becomes magical.</p>
<p>This is what <code>ghp-import</code> was written for.</p>
<h2>Big Fat Warning</h2>
<p>This will <strong>DESTROY</strong> your <code>gh-pages</code> branch. If you love it, you'll want to
take backups before playing with this. This script assumes that <code>gh-pages</code> is
100% derivative. You should never edit files in your <code>gh-pages</code> branch by hand
if you're using this script because you will lose your work.</p>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<pre><code>Usage: ghp-import [OPTIONS] DIRECTORY

Options:
  -n          Include a .nojekyll file in the branch.
  -m MESG     The commit message to use on the target branch.
  -p          Push the branch to origin/{branch} after committing.
  -r REMOTE   The name of the remote to push to. [origin]
  -b BRANCH   Name of the branch to write to. [gh-pages]
  -h, --help  show this help message and exit
</code></pre>
<p>Its pretty simple. Inside your repository just run <code>ghp-import $DOCS_DIR</code>
where <code>$DOCS_DIR</code> is the path to the <strong>built</strong> documentation. This will write a
commit to your <code>gh-pages</code> branch with the current documents in it.</p>
<p>If you specify <code>-p</code> it will also attempt to push the <code>gh-pages</code> branch to
GitHub. By default it'll just run <code>git push origin gh-pages</code>. You can specify
a different remote using the <code>-r</code> flag.</p>
<p>You can specify a different branch with <code>-b</code>. This is useful for user and
organization page, which are served from the <code>master</code> branch.</p>
<p><code>ghp-import</code> also recognizes the <code>GIT_DIR</code> environment variable which can be
useful for Git hooks.</p>
